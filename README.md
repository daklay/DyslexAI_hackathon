# DyslexAI
> Personalized AI learning for dyslexic individuals.


DyslexAI is a project developed during a hackathon aimed at addressing the needs of people with dyslexia. It is a game designed to assist dyslexic individuals in improving their cognitive skills through personalized learning experiences.
## Features
- **AI Prediction Model**: The project utilizes an AI prediction model that analyzes factors like correct answers compared to the number of questions attempted to recommend suitable difficulty levels for dyslexic learners. This personalized approach enhances the learning experience for each individual.

## How It Works
The game presents users with a series of challenges and adapts the difficulty level based on their performance. The AI prediction model continuously evaluates the user's progress and adjusts the game dynamically to provide an optimal learning environment.
